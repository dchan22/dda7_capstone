Smoking Rates in the U.S
  Have cigarettes usage decline? Are cigarette smokers quitting because of price?
  Over the years excise taxes on tobacco have increase. With these taxes, have smoking rates increase or decrease? Looking at taxes, household income came to mind. So does household income affect cigarette usage? I also want to look at the legalization marijuana, is there any correlation?
