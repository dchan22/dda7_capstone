## Motivation
  Having worked in the tobacco industry for the past 17 years(on the smokeless side), I have worked long hours. Wanting to see if demands was that high for the long hours. Also the industry now have a lot of restrictions over the years. And now there are many alternatives to smoking (cigarettes).


## Data Questions
  Have cigarettes usage decline? Are cigarette smokers quitting because of price?
  Over the years excise taxes on tobacco have increase. With these taxes, have smoking rates increase or decrease? Looking at taxes, household income came to mind. So does household income affect cigarette usage? I also want to look at the legalization marijuana, is there any correlation?
